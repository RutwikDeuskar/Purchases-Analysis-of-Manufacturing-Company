###  Concepts Explained for Non-Finance Users

#### â€¢ **TDS (Tax Deducted at Source):**
TDS is a tax collected by the buyer on behalf of the government while making specified payments. Different sections (194C, 194Q, 194J) apply based on type of service and vendor.

#### â€¢ **GST (Goods and Services Tax):**
GST is an indirect tax levied on goods and services. This report focuses on Input GST (tax paid on purchases). If payments are delayed >180 days, Input GST may need to be reversed.

#### â€¢ **RCM (Reverse Charge Mechanism):**
Under certain conditions, the buyer is liable to pay GST directly instead of the seller.

#### â€¢ **Related Party Transactions:**
Transactions with group companies or affiliates, often requiring separate disclosures for compliance.

#### â€¢ **Vendor State Mapping:**
The first two digits of a GSTIN represent the state code, allowing the dashboard to map purchases geographically.
